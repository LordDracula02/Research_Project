Face Invariant Classification and Detection of Mythology Characters Using Custom Dataset (ClaDeMuC-CD)
Overview
This project presents a novel approach for the classification and detection of mythology characters using a custom-built dataset and advanced deep learning models. The work was published at an IEEE conference and demonstrates robust performance in recognizing and localizing characters across diverse visual conditions.

Abstract
The ClaDeMuC-CD project addresses the challenge of face-invariant recognition and detection of mythology characters from images. By constructing a custom dataset and leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures—including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and YOLOv5—this research achieves high accuracy in both classification and object detection tasks. The project explores data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, highlighting the effectiveness of modern AI techniques for complex visual recognition problems.
